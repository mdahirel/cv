## My CV made using Quarto and LaTeX

The LaTeX part of the code is heavily inspired from :  

> Making Pretty PDFs with Quarto.  
> Nicola Rennie  
> February 17, 2023  
> nrennie.rbind.io/blog/making-pretty-pdf-quarto

I took the idea of using Google Sheets to fill and update the CV from Nick Strayer's CV : https://github.com/nstrayer/cv
