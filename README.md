## My CV made using Quarto and LaTeX

The LaTeX part of the code is heavily inspired from a post by Nicola Rennie: https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/making-pretty-pdf-quarto/

I took the idea of using Google Sheets to fill and update the CV from Nick Strayer's CV : https://github.com/nstrayer/cv  

(the one-page `resume.pdf` and corresponding code are drafts in progress and not meant to be used just yet)
